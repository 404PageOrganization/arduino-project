# Arduino-up_and_down
this is the project about the arduino which controls the machine up and down.


### Step 1 : Install IRremote library

Download the zip from [GitHub - IRremote](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote) and add to the Arduino IDLE library.

### Step 2 : Get IRremote code

Connect the IR receiver to `pin 11` on the Arduion board and upload `readIR.ino`

Open the `serial monitor` in IDLE, then press the `up` and `down` button on the IR Controller. The result will show on the monitor window.

### Step 3 : Set parameter

Copy the hex code get from `Step 2` and paste it in `sketch.ino`.

Upload the code and open `serial monitor` . If everything correct, it will print "Motor up/down" signal.

### Step 4 : Connect the Motor

Connect the motor `up pin` to 9 and `down pin` to 10. Pressing the button on IR Controller and see whether the motor moves.

### Step 5 : Test the motor's speed

Move the motor to one side, pressing `up` botton and starting the timer. When the motor stop on the other side, stop and read the timer.

### Step 6 : Run testEEPROM.ino

### Step 7 : Init the EEPROM by buliding and running initEEPROM.ino

### Step 8 : All done

Paste the data get from Step 2 and Step 5 into the `sketch_with_timer.ino` , upload it and see whether it runs well.
